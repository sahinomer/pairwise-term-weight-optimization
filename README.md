# Pairwise Term Weight Optimization
Learning term weights by overfitting pairwise ranking loss is an optimization function that learns optimal weights for query terms to achieve a higher weighted BM25 score for relevant documents than irrelevant ones. For each query, a set of weights for terms are optimized by pairwise ranking loss. The set of weights of the query terms is unique and independent from the other queries. Optimization is applied over the BM25 scores of each term in the query. *TF* and *IDF* values of the terms are included in the optimization of term weights in a query by comparing relevant and irrelevant document pairs.

The pairwise optimization aims to provide the following condition:

$BM25_{tw}(D_{Relevant}, Q) \geq  BM25_{tw}(D_{Irrelevant}, Q) + \alpha$

where $\alpha$ is the margin between relevant and irrelevant document pairs, assuring that the difference between a relevant and irrelevant document is at least $\alpha$.
